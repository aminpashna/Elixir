# Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace / Synapse Studio / Monitoring

## Learn about monitoring your workspace in Azure Synapse Analytics Studio

Cloud applications are complex and have many moving parts. Monitors provide data to help ensure that your applications stay up and running in a healthy state. Monitors also help you avoid potential problems and troubleshoot past ones. You can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your applications. This knowledge helps you improve application performance and maintainability. It also helps you automate actions that otherwise require manual intervention.

> **Note**: Interactive Spark jobs will never reach the *Succeeded* state; they'll reach the *Stop* state instead. Only batch jobs can reach the *Succeeded* state. Users can submit Spark batch jobs with a Spark job definition in Azure Synapse Studio.
